       "'The Indian Premier League (IPL), also known as the TATA IPL for sponsorship reasons, is a men\\'s Twenty20 (T20) cricket league held annually in India. Founded by the BCCI (the Board of Control for Cricket in India) in 2007, the league features ten state or city-based franchise teams.[3][4] Most popular and biggest cricket league, it usually takes place during the summer for 2 months, between March and May each year. It has an exclusive window in the ICC Future Tours Programme, resulting in fewer international cricket tours occurring during the IPL seasons.[5]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2014, it ranked sixth in average attendance among all sports leagues.[6] In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event to be broadcast live on YouTube.[7][8] Inspired by the success of the IPL, other Indian sports leagues have been established.[a][11][12][13] In 2022, the league\\'s brand value was estimated at ₹90,038 crore (US$11 billion).[14] According to the BCCI, the 2015 IPL season contributed ₹1,150 crore (US$140 million) to India\\'s GDP.[15] In December 2022, the IPL achieved a valuation of US$10.9 billion, becoming a decacorn and registering a 75% growth in dollar terms since 2020 when it was valued at $6.2 billion, according to a report by the consulting firm D and P Advisory.[16] Its 2023 final became the most streamed live event on the internet, with 32 million viewers.[17]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2023, the league sold its media rights for the next 4 seasons for US$6.4 billion to Viacom18 and Star Sports,[18] meaning each IPL match was valued at $13.4 million.[19] As of 2024, there have been seventeen seasons of the tournament. The current champions are the Kolkata Knight Riders, who won the 2024 season after defeating the Sunrisers Hyderabad in the final.[20]\\r\\n\\r\\nHistory\\r\\nWinners\\r\\nIndian Premier League\\r\\nSeason\\tWinners\\r\\n2008\\tRajasthan Royals\\r\\n2009\\tDeccan Chargers\\r\\n2010\\tChennai Super Kings\\r\\n2011\\tChennai Super Kings (2)\\r\\n2012\\tKolkata Knight Riders\\r\\n2013\\tMumbai Indians\\r\\n2014\\tKolkata Knight Riders (2)\\r\\n2015\\tMumbai Indians (2)\\r\\n2016\\tSunrisers Hyderabad \\r\\n2017\\tMumbai Indians (3)\\r\\n2018\\tChennai Super Kings (3)\\r\\n2019\\tMumbai Indians (4)\\r\\n2020\\tMumbai Indians (5)\\r\\n2021\\tChennai Super Kings (4)\\r\\n2022\\tGujarat Titans\\r\\n2023\\tChennai Super Kings (5)\\r\\n2024\\tKolkata Knight Riders (3)\\r\\nInspired by a rival\\r\\nIn 2007, Zee Entertainment Enterprises founded the Indian Cricket League (ICL).[21] The ICL was not recognized by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) or the International Cricket Council (ICC). Moreover, the BCCI was unhappy about its committee members joining the ICL executive board.[22] In response, the BCCI increased the prize money for its domestic tournaments and imposed lifetime bans on players who joined the rival league, which it considered a rebel league.[23][24]\\r\\n\\r\\nFoundation\\r\\nOn 13 September 2007,[25] following India\\'s victory at the 2007 T20 World Cup,[26] the BCCI announced a franchise based Twenty20 cricket competition known as the Indian Premier League. The inaugural season was scheduled to start in April 2008, commencing with a \"high-profile ceremony\" in New Delhi. BCCI Vice-president Lalit Modi, who led the IPL initiative, provided details of the tournament, including its format, prize money, franchise revenue system, and squad composition rules. The league, to be managed by a seven-man governing council, would also serve as the qualifying mechanism for that year\\'s Champions League Twenty20.[25]\\r\\n\\r\\nTo determine team ownership, an auction for the franchises was held on 24 January 2008. The reserve prices for the eight franchises totalled $400 million,[24] but the auction ultimately raised $723.59 million.[27] The league officially commenced in April 2008, featuring Chennai Super Kings (CSK), Mumbai Indians (MI), Delhi Daredevils (DD), Kings XI Punjab (KXIP), Deccan Chargers (DC), Rajasthan Royals (RR), Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), and Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB).[28]\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the ban on players who chose to participate in the ICL, the rival league shut down in 2009.[29][30]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA match during the 2008 IPL inaugural season in Chennai\\r\\nExpansions and terminations\\r\\nNew franchises, Pune Warriors India and Kochi Tuskers Kerala, joined the league before the fourth season in 2011.[31] The Sahara Adventure Sports Group purchased the Pune franchise for $370 million, while Rendezvous Sports World bought the Kochi franchise for $333.3 million.[31] The Kochi franchise was terminated after just one season due to their failure to pay the BCCI the 10% bank guarantee element of the franchise fee.[32]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn September 2012, the Deccan Chargers franchise agreement was terminated after the BCCI failed to find new owners.[33] In October, an auction was held for a replacement franchise; Sun TV Network won the bid for what became the Hyderabad franchise;[34] the team was named Sunrisers Hyderabad.[35]\\r\\n\\r\\nPune Warriors India withdrew from the IPL in May 2013 due to financial differences with the BCCI.[36] The BCCI officially terminated the franchise in October, and the league reverted to eight teams.[37]\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2015, the two-time champions Chennai Super Kings and the inaugural season champions Rajasthan Royals were suspended for two seasons following their involvement in a spot-fixing and betting scandal.[38] The two teams were replaced for two seasons by franchises based in Pune and Rajkot.[39][40]\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the venue for the 2020 season was moved and games were played in the United Arab Emirates.[41][42] In August 2021, the BCCI announced that two new franchises, based in two of six shortlisted cities, would join the league in the 2022 season.[43][44] In closed bidding held in October, the RPSG Group and CVC Capital won the bids for the teams, paying ₹7,000 crore (US$840 million) and ₹5,200 crore (US$620 million), respectively.[45][46] The teams were subsequently named Lucknow Super Giants and Gujarat Titans.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral IPL franchise owners have expanded their business by acquiring teams in other franchise leagues, such as the Caribbean Premier League (CPL), South Africa\\'s SA20, the UAE\\'s International League T20 (ILT) and the USA\\'s Major League Cricket (MLC). These teams have been branded with similar names to their parent IPL franchises.[47]\\r\\n\\r\\nIndian Premier League\\tCPL\\tSA20\\tILT\\tMLC\\r\\nChennai Super Kings\\t\\tJoburg Super Kings\\t\\tTexas Super Kings\\r\\nDelhi Capitals\\t\\tPretoria Capitals\\tDubai Capitals\\t\\r\\nGujarat Titans\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nKolkata Knight Riders\\tTrinbago Knight Riders\\t\\tAbu Dhabi Knight Riders\\tLos Angeles Knight Riders\\r\\nLucknow Super Giants\\t\\tDurban\\'s Super Giants\\t\\t\\r\\nMumbai Indians\\t\\tMI Cape Town\\tMI Emirates\\tMI New York\\r\\nPunjab Kings\\tSaint Lucia Kings\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nRajasthan Royals\\tBarbados Royals\\tPaarl Royals\\t\\t\\r\\nRoyal Challengers Bengaluru\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\nSunrisers Hyderabad\\t\\tSunrisers Eastern Cape\\t\\t\\r\\nIn addition to the above acquisitions, Delhi Capitals also bought a stake in MLC\\'s Seattle Orcas.[48]\\r\\n\\r\\nOrganization\\r\\nThe IPL\\'s headquarters are located in the Cricket Centre, next to the Wankhede Stadium in Churchgate, Mumbai. The Governing Council is responsible for the league\\'s functions, including the organization of tournaments. As of April 2023, its members included:[49]\\r\\n\\r\\nArun Singh Dhumal – Chairman[50][51]\\r\\nJay Shah – Secretary of the BCCI\\r\\nAshish Shelar – Treasurer, BCCI\\r\\nAvishek Dalmiya\\r\\nPragyan Ojha – Indian Cricketers\\' Association\\'s representative\\r\\nAlka Rehani Bhardwaj – Comptroller and Auditor General of India nominee\\r\\nPlayer acquisition, squad composition, and salaries\\r\\nA team can acquire players through the annual player auction, trading with other teams during trading windows, and signing replacements for unavailable players. Players sign up for the auction[52] and set their base price and are bought by the highest-bidding franchise. Unsold players at the auction can become replacement signings. Trades require player consent, and any contract differences are covered by the franchise. There are typically three trading windows: two before the auction and one before the tournament. No trading is allowed outside these windows or during the tournament, but replacements can be signed before or during the event.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther notable rules, as of the 2024 season, include:\\r\\n\\r\\nThe salary cap of the entire squad have been allotted a purse of ₹100 crore each.[53]\\r\\nUnder-19 players cannot be picked unless they have previously played first-class or List A cricket.[54]\\r\\nPlayer contracts run for one year but can be extended by one or two years if the franchises take up the option. Since the 2014 season, player contracts have been denominated in the Indian rupee, before which the contracts were in the US dollar. Overseas players can be remunerated in the currency of the player\\'s choice, at the exchange rate on either the contract due date or the actual payment date.[55] Before the 2014 season, Indian domestic players were not included in the player auction pool. They could be signed up by franchises at a discrete amount while a fixed sum of ₹10 lakh (US$12,000) to ₹30 lakh (US$36,000) would be deducted per signing from the franchise\\'s salary purse. This received significant opposition from franchise owners, who complained richer franchises were \"luring players with under-the-table deals.\" The IPL later decided to include domestic players in the player auction.[56]\\r\\n\\r\\nThe BCCI give 10% of foreign players\\' salaries to their country\\'s national cricket board.[57]'"
